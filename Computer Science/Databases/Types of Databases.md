There are many types of databases. The best database for a specific organization depends on how the organization intends to use the data.
## Relational Databases
Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows where data is placed into predefined categories. Each table has columns with at least one data category, and rows that have a certain data instance for the categories that are defined in the columns.
Relational databases use SQL in their user and application programming interfaces (APIs). A new data category can easily be added to a relational database without having to change existing applications.
## Object Oriented Databases
Object oriented databases hold data created using object oriented programming languages. They focus on organizing objects rather than actions and data rather than logic. For instance, an image data record would be a data object rather than an alphanumeric value.
## Distributed Databases
A distributed database consists of two or more files located in different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers, located in the same physical location, or scattered over different networks. Distributed databases can be homogeneous, where all physical locations have the same underlying hardware and run the same operating system (OS) and database applications. They can also be heterogeneous. In those cases, the hardware, OS, and database applications can be different in the various locations.
## Data Warehouses
This is a repository of data from an organization's operational systems and other sources. Data warehouses are commonly designed for fast querying and analysis. Typically, a data warehouse is a relational database that's either on-premises in the data center or in the cloud.
## NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases, or nonrelational databases, allow unstructured or semi structured data to be stored an manipulated.
NoSQL databases are good when dealing with large collections of distributed data. They can address big data performance issues better than relational databases. They also do well analyzing large unstructured data sets and data on virtual servers in the cloud.
## Graph Databases
Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database. They store, map and query relationships using concepts from graph theory. Graph databases are made up of nodes and edges. Nodes are entities that store the data objects. These databases often provide better performance and flexibility as they are more suited for modeling real-world scenarios.
## Cloud Databases
A cloud database is a collection of data, either structured or unstructured, that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform. There are two types of cloud database models: traditional and database as a service (DBaaS). With DBaaS, administrative tasks and maintenance are performed by a services provider and users are charged based on how much storage and bandwidth they use. They also get scalability on demand and high availability.
## Multimodel Database
Multimodel databases combine different types of database models into a single, integrated back end. This means they can accommodate various data types.
Being multimodel enables IT teams to meet various requirements without needing to deploy different database systems.
## Document/JSON Databases
A document database is a database that stores data in JSON format rather than rows and columns.
Document databases are considered to be NoSQL databases. Instead of storing data in fixed rows and columns, document databases use flexible documents.
## Self-driving databases
A self-driving, or autonomous database, is a newer type of database that automates regular data management tasks, such as backups, updates, tuning and security. These databases are cloud-based and use machine learning processes in their automation. Self-driving databases require minimal human intervention to handle day-to-day operations. This reduces the time required for database administrators to manage a database.
