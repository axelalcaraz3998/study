Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
SQL consists of many type of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data Query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).
The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language, it also includes procedural elements.
## Components of a SQL System
Relational database management systems (RDBMS) use SQL to store and manage data. The system stores multiple database tables that relate to each other.
### SQL Table
A SQL table is the basic element of a relational database. The SQL database consists of rows and columns. Database engineers create relationships between multiple database tables to optimize data storage space.
### SQL Statements
SQL statements, or SQL queries, are valid instructions that RDBMS understand. Software developers build SQL statements by using different SQL language elements. SQL language elements are components such as identifiers, variables and search conditions that form a correct SQL statement.
### Stored procedures
Stored procedures are a collection of one or more SQL statements stored in the relational database. Software developers use stored procedures to improve efficiency and performance.
## SQL Commands
SQL commands are specific keywords or SQL statements that developers use to manipulate the data stored in a relational database. They are categorized as follows.
### Data Definition Language (DDL)
Data definition language refers to SQL commands that design the database structure. Database engineers use DDL to create and modify objects based on the business requirements. For example, the database engineer uses the CREATE command to create database objects such as tables, views and indexes.
### Data Query Language (DQL)
Data query language consists of instructions for retrieving data stored in relational databases. Software applications use the SELECT command to filter and return specific results from a SQL table.
### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Data manipulation language statements write new information or modify existing records in a relational database. For example, an application uses the INSERT command to store a new record in the database.
### Data Control Language (DCL)
Database administrators use data control language to manage and authorize database access for other users. For example, they can use the GRANT command to permit certain applications to manipulate one or more tables.
### Transaction Control Language (TCL)
The relational engine uses transaction control language to automatically make database changes. For example, the database uses the ROLLBACK command to undo an erroneous transaction.
