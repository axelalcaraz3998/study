A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.
Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. They collect information on people, places or things. This information is gathered in one place so it can be observed and analyzed.
There are many different types of databases. They're classified according to content type: bibliographic, full text, numeric and images. In computing, databases are often classified by the organizational approach they use.
