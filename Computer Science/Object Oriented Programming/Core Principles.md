There are four major theoretical principles of Object Oriented Programming. These are *Encapsulation*, *Abstraction*, *Inheritance* and *Polymorphism*.
## Encapsulation
The encapsulation principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed. The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class. Other objects do not have access to this class or have the authority to make changes. They are only able to call a list of public functions or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.
## Abstraction
Abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects. This concept can help developers more easily make additional changes or additions over time.
## Inheritance
Inheritance defines the capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class. Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse common logic, while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. Inheritance forces more thorough data analysis and reduces development time and redundancy.
## Polymorphism
The word polymorphism means having many forms. We can define polymorphism as the ability of an object to take on more than one form. The program determines which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object from a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate code. Polymorphism enables different types of objects to pass through the same interface.
