## SOLID Principles
In software programming, SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make object oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
These principles establish practices for developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending it as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also help avoid code smells, refactor code, and develop Agile or Adaptative software.
SOLID stands for *Single Responsibility Principle*, *Open-closed Principle*, *Liskov Substitution Principle*, *Interface Segregation Principle* and *Dependency Inversion Principle*.
### Single Responsibility Principle
Single responsibility principle states that there should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
### Open-closed Principle
Open-closed principle states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
### Liskov Substitution Principle
Liskov substitution principle states that functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it. That is, every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
### Interface Segregation Principle
Interface segregation principle states that clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. It simply means that larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones, ensuring that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methos that are of interest to them.
### Dependency Inversion Principle
Dependency inversion principle states that entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Don't repeat yourself is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstractions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place.
The DRY principle states that every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Keep it simple, stupid is a design principle that implies that simplicity should be a design goal.
KISS principle states that designs and or systems should be as simple as possible. Wherever possible, complexity should be avoided in a system, as simplicity guarantees the greatest level of user acceptance and interaction.
## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
You aren't gonna need it is a principle which arose from extreme programming that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. It means that you should not implement functionality just because you think that you may need it someday, but implement it when you really need it.
